Just remember that if the interest was not entered in decimal format then you have to convert it to a decimal format. For example, if the interest rate is 5% then you have to convert it to 0.05. Then you have a stored memory of the chat history. When you are asked to calculate the mortgage rate, and one (1) or two (2) variables are missing then just use the previous variables to fill up the missing variables as stored in your chat history.",
