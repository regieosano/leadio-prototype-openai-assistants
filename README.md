# Leadio Prototype Openai Assistants
A prototype to have the OpenAI Assistants for ChatBots 

Be able to create these functionalities:

1. RETRIEVAL: As a user, I want to chat with the bot about the company. This is already done, using attached files, so the bot can draw conversation content from company website in the docs.
   
2. FUNCTION: As a user, I want to ask the bot what the current mortgage rate is and retrieve an external value, something simple to get from an API.
   
3. FUNCTION: As a user, I want to ask the bot a question, and have it share the most appropriate videos. The function will retrieve videos from a reference file and show them in the chat
   
4. FUNCTION: As a admin, I want the bot to ask the user for their name and email address, and I want the ability to extract entity fields from the conversation and send them to CRM.

Then, this can be done inside Open AI on the AI Assistant using their functions and then it can be used no matter how we connect to the Assistant.
